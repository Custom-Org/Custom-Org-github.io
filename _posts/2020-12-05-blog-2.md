# Setting up Discipline and Making it a Habbit for rest of my life via 21 day habbit challenge

So, acctually it would be a 25 day challenge from 6th dec to 31th dec. i will make sure that i give a update that I have gone through that day as I have planned or not before going to bed at night.
I will try to follow the core principles, by that i mean the whole structure of a day will be the same but it may happen that those points move a bit i mean starting and ending time may shilft but 
ammount of effort will be the same.
