I am thinking about dieing, that I may die after my graduation, but I dont want to die untill I payback the loan money that I have taken from bank, and if die my parents will be bankrupted, and always blame me for having a wish to get into engineering. but all this time I was trying to help, so there is nobody besides me, and I have my family to carry they belive in me and I also belive in myself, no matter what I will see through, because there are people looking for my, want me to work hard ang get my dreams code through, and this I am talking about is to get a job and make my family forever,as in our family my father really worked hard we dont have anybody who has propper job no propper education and they always struggled and people looked down upon us, but my father and uncle are strong enough to handle that and move forward. Sometimes I feel if I could share these things to somebody. Although in what position i'm in I can get a job if I really try, its not impossible. I want to get a job and I will get a job, I will work hard and smart from this second on word, and find my way through thiese mess.
